# OFFENSECOM
`offensecom` (*offen-si-calm*) is an [ncurses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses#:~:text=ncurses%20(new%20curses)%20is%20a,a%20computer%20terminal%2Dindependent%20manner.) based user interface for any kinds of communications solution you wish to embark upon. This can range from communicating with a friend, to creating a C2 that handles reverse shells from any kind of system you want. Offensecom handles the UI aspect, allowing you to develop your own communications solution without spending time on handling UI.

**WARNING:** This is not designed as a real solution, and is merely a project I was working on for fun.
