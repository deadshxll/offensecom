# OFFENSECOM
`offensecom` (*offen-si-calm*) is an [ncurses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ncurses#:~:text=ncurses%20(new%20curses)%20is%20a,a%20computer%20terminal%2Dindependent%20manner.) based user interface for any kinds of communications solution you wish to embark upon. This can range from communicating with a friend, to creating a C2 that handles reverse shells from any kind of system you want. Offensecom handles the UI aspect, allowing you to develop your own communications solution without spending time on handling UI.

**WARNING:** This is not designed as a real solution, and is merely a project I was working on for fun.

## How to build/run
First, clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/deadshxll/offensecom.git
```
Now cd into the directory and run the `run.sh` script.
```c
cd offensecom
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh
```
This will build the project and output the binary into the current directory inside the `build/` folder.
